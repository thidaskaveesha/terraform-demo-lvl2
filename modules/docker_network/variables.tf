# Variables for Docker Network Module
# Currently this module doesn't need any input variables
# because the network name is hardcoded as "flask_net"
# 
# In the future, we could add variables like:
# - network_name (to make network name configurable)
# - subnet (to specify custom IP range)
# - driver (to use different network drivers like overlay)
